🤔 What is Nullish Coalescing in JavaScript?

◩ It's a new operator added in JavaScript that is a nullish coalescing operator(??).

◩ If a variable is 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱 but is neither 𝗻𝘂𝗹𝗹 nor 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱, then the first argument returns as output.

◩ In other words, the nullish coalescing operator returns the first argument if it's not "𝗻𝘂𝗹𝗹" or "𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗱" otherwise the second argument will be returned. 

◩ A double question mark( ?? ) is the sign of this operator. [pic.twitter.com/v7goKVTAW5](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1544207748593639424/photo/1)

🤔 What is the difference between Nullish Coalescing and logical OR operator?

◩ Have you noticed nullish operator also works with the logical OR(||) operator?

◩ But there is a difference between both of them!

◩ The logical OR(||) operator returns the first truthy value.

◩ But the nullish operator returns the first "defined" value.

◩ That means the nullish operator can also return falsy values but not returns "null" and "undefined" values. [pic.twitter.com/uHkNcrXwu8](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1544207757787549696/photo/1)
