Swapna Kumar Panda ([@swapnakpanda](https://twitter.com/swapnakpanda)) - July 4, 2022 4:45 PM

I mentored a 22-year-old who received a remote job offer of a package of $40K annum for a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer position. It took him 3 months.

20+ key points he followed to achieve this ↓

➊  Save time by being smart

⬘  I suggested he should follow specific resources for learning instead of too many. Resources include books, articles, and video tutorials.

⬙  Few such resources are
   ❍ javascript. info
   ❍ freeCodeCamp
   ❍ Geeks 4 Geeks
   ❍ Programiz

➋  Stop comparing Education

⬘  During our first interaction, he stated "I am from a Tier-3 College".

⬙  My suggestions
   ❍  Stop demeaning yourself
   ❍  Don't waste time on what didn't happen
   ❍  Invest your time in learning whatever missed during graduation

➌  Choose the right career path

⬘  His major was not Computer Science. But during academics, he learned a few computer subjects.

⬙  I evaluated his skills and, suggested going for Web Development. Because of
   ❍  Good artistic/visual skill
   ❍  Average analytical skill

➍  Practice during learning

⬘  Learning by reading or, watching puts a concept in your brain for a few moments.

⬗  But by practicing, the concept remains forever.

⬙  During studying, try to form questions yourself.

Try to solve as many as possible.

➎  Avoid Tutorial Hell & FOMO

⬘  Do not watch excess video resources. Read from blogs and, documentation as well.

⬙  Don't change your path with a FOMO (Fear of Missing out). Give your best whichever path you have chosen.

➏  Learn and start using Git as early as possible

You should use Git because

   ❍  Your code is safely stored
   ❍  Allows version management
   ❍  You can track your progress
   ❍  You can share your work with others

Learn Git and start using GitHub or, GitLab.

➐  Start with simple HTML & CSS

Follow this roadmap.

➓  Learn TypeScript

⬘  Do not hesitate to switch to TypeScript.

⬗  TypeScript is all that you have in JavaScript, but with extra features and, support for types.

⬙  Using strong types helps you
    ❍  develop less error-prone code
    ❍  switch easily to other languages

➊➊  Be modular

⬘  Learn to develop modular type code.

⬗  Instead of developing a monolithic huge code, try to segregate them into multiple pieces.

⬙  Smaller units are easy to maintain and, help in reducing network bandwidth.

➊➋  Learn React

⬘  I didn't force it upon him. I gave him short tutorials on both React and, Vue.

⬗  I found him showing more interest in React.

⬙  I suggested using more "Function Components". With his experience, "Class Components" wasn't that needed.

➊➌  Learn Next.js

⬘  React is a library. Next.js is a React-based framework.

⬗  Using Next.js, one can generate static sites and, can do the server-side rendering as well.

⬙  Applications can be easily and, fast developed using Next.js.

➊➍ Problem Solving Skills

⬘ Full-Stack developers require to possess problem solving skills.

⬗ I told the knowledge of DSA is very important and, can be learned by only practicing.

⬙ I suggested starting with simple data structures and, algorithms.

➊➎  Back-End with Node.js & Express

⬘  I suggested Node.js because he doesn't have to learn a separate language.

⬗  He can later switch to other technology after gaining some experience.

⬙  Express is a Node.js-based framework and, easy to start.

➊➏  Database with MySQL & MongoDB

⬘  I suggested learning the basics of both MySQL and, MongoDB. It would allow him to have knowledge of both SQL & NoSQL.

⬙  As a beginner, he just has to learn simple schema creation, querying, data insert, update, delete etc.

➊➐  Build complete projects

⬘  Using all the skills you achieved, build a few sample projects.

⬗  Host them using some free services like Vercel or, Netlify.

⬙  These projects would evaluate your skills. So, keep on improving them.

➊➑  Personal Portfolio

A portfolio website is like a passport. Recruiters could find a lot of details from this about you.

   ❍  Tell about yourself
   ❍  Brief about your projects, achievements
   ❍  Share your GitHub link
   ❍  Make it responsive
   ❍  Make it fast

➊➒  Build Resume

A resume is one more important thing like the Portfolio website.

   ❍  Have a nice presentation
   ❍  Keep it short 'n' simple

   ❍  Use keywords like "Full Stack", "JavaScript", "React", "MERN" for more visibility

   ❍  Do not use too many fonts

20.  Build Connections

⬘  You may possess 1000 skills, but all in vain if you don't have many connections. Connections provide opportunities.

⬗  Using online mode, you can build connections rapidly.

⬙  Join one or more social media. Connect with people. Build relations.

➋➊  Be ready for a few failures

They said, "Failures are pillars of Success".

⬘  You may fail badly during the first few interviews.

⬗  Without getting demotivated, learn what recruiters are expecting.

⬙  Improve your skills, resume, portfolio, and projects.

🏁 Finally

⬘  It was a wonderful experience for me to mentor someone and, make him job-ready.

⬙  It wouldn't have been possible without his positive mindset though.

🚥 Disclaimer

⬘  It's a 2-month-old story. I am sharing it again as one of my memorable achievements in the last 1 year journey.

⬙  I mentored and guided him on the said path. But, I didn't facilitate any (remote) job interviews. He got those by making connections.
