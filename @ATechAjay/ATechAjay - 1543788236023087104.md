⚡ Difference Between 𝗦𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗲 And 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 String Methods?

A Thread🧵↓ [pic.twitter.com/w2Nw7FkEto](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1543788236023087104/photo/1)

◈ Before learning the differences we have to know what is the use of slice and substring methods.

◈ Then we will be able to understand the difference between both of them.

😍 So without further a do, let's get into the thread...

🤔 Use of 𝘀𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗲 and 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 methods?

- Both are used to return a sub-part of the string from the starting index to the end index of the string.

- But the end index is not included which means these methods do not return the end index into the new sub-string. [pic.twitter.com/5rsvEwawSv](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1543788246018117632/photo/1)

- Both methods don't change the original string.

- Also, both methods have 2 parameters the first parameter refers to the start index, and the second parameter refers to the end index of the string.

😂 But what's the difference?

🤔 Difference Between 𝗦𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗲 And 𝗦𝘂𝗯𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 String Methods?

- There is a subtle difference between both methods.

1️⃣ 𝘀𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗲( ) method:

1. It returns nothing(empty) if the start index is greater than the index.

2. It treats the NaN parameter as a 0.

3. When we give a -ve parameter to it then it counts backward from the end of the string to find that indexes.

📌 Remember it does not include the last index. [pic.twitter.com/7KA0R99tDn](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1543788257443360769/photo/1)

2️⃣ 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 method

1. If the start parameter is greater than the end parameter then it swaps that parameters.

2. It treats the negative parameter as 0.

📌 Remember it does not include the last index as well. [pic.twitter.com/NAQn1T25Vp](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1543788264309411841/photo/1)
