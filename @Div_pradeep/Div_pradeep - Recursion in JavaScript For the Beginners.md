⚡Recursion in JavaScript For the Beginners⚡⚡

What is recursion in javascript?

→ Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.

→ Suppose that you have a function called 'recurse()`. The recurse() is a recursive function if it calls itself inside its body

→ A recursive function always has a condition to stop calling itself. 

→ Otherwise, it will call itself indefinitely. 

→ Once the condition is met, the function stops calling itself. This is called a base condition.

→ So a recursive function looks like this: [pic.twitter.com/YmU28VMWwE](https://twitter.com/Div_pradeep/status/1546094253696098306/photo/1)

→ To prevent infinite recursion, we can use if...else statement where one branch makes the recursive call, and the other doesn't. As shown in above example.

Using recursive functions (Example):

→ Suppose that you need to develop a function that counts down from a specified number to 1.

→ For example, to count down from 5 to 1: [pic.twitter.com/Zt74Z8CHwe](https://twitter.com/Div_pradeep/status/1546094263338803202/photo/1)

![3_1546094258372763648](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXTUiVOUYAAcb6P.jpg)

→ In the above program, the user passes a number as an argument when calling a function.

→ In each iteration, the number value is decreased by 1 and the function countDown() is called until the number is positive.

 → Here, newNumber > 0 is the base condition.

→ When the number reaches 0, the base condition is met, and the function is not called anymore.

That's all for now.
