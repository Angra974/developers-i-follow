‚õî There is a small change for the "line" of the progress in the HTML element.

üòç And rest things are the same as in the above thread. [pic.twitter.com/htTl82SGBr](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1544587434226098179/photo/1)

![3_1544587429759238145](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FW96FXNVQAEHjfs.png)

‚ó© So first of all we have to select all required HTML elements using JavaScript. [pic.twitter.com/59rYqBvbbu](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1544587440316248064/photo/1)

![3_1544587436025450497](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FW96FujUEAEgkSn.png)

‚ó© And create a variable called "active" it's responsible for current active circles and lines of the "progress step" as well. [pic.twitter.com/aBeVxhdPog](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1544587446016286721/photo/1)

![3_1544587441884999680](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FW96GEYVsAAHn__.png)

üîî Then we have to listen to an event on both buttons, so for the "next" button, we want to increase the active value after each click.

‚ó© That's why I'm going to increase active value with increment operator.

‚ó© And the value of the "active" variable shouldn't be greater than the elements.

‚ó© That's why we are checking, if the active value is greater than the circles then the last value should be assigned as the value of the "active" variable.

‚ó© Finally, we have to call a new function! [pic.twitter.com/HcbGLs2qNV](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1544587456917278721/photo/1)

![3_1544587452630700033](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FW96GsaUEAELSN-.png)

‚ó© Now for the "prev" (previous) button we have to decrease the "active" variable value.

‚ó© And the value of the "active" variable shouldn't be less than 1 if yes then the value will be 1 as well.

‚ó© Finally, we have to call a new function for the rest of things. [pic.twitter.com/mznP0I760f](https://twitter.com/ATechAjay/status/1544587463460409344/photo/1)
